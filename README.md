This Golang project utilizes the Gin web framework and the AWS SDK to create a simple web application for uploading text files. Users can input a file name and text content, which is then saved locally and uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket. The project includes features such as error handling, AWS S3 integration, and a basic web interface. The code showcases the use of Gin for handling HTTP requests, AWS S3 for cloud storage, and file operations in Go. Feel free to explore and adapt it for your needs!
